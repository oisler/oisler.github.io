        <h2>Who am I</h2>
        <p>A middle-aged guy from switzerland who spends most of his time programming.<br>When I'm not writing
            code, I like to read books of various kinds, listen to music, podcasts or do sports.<br>Of course, I also
            enjoy spending time with my family and friends.</p>
        <h2>What am I doing</h2>
        <p>Currently I am working as a devops engineer. Therefore, I am interested in every practice and every process
            of the devops lifecycle.<br>My favorite thing to do is writing code and my go-to language is Java. Even if
            I really love it I sometimes go on adventures.<br>Hence I am spending some of my extra time learning new
            skills like web development.</p>
