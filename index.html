        <h2>DevOps Engineer</h2>
        <p>I am currently working as a devops engineer and interested in every practice and process of the devops lifecycle.<br>
            My favorite thing to do is writing code and my go-to language is Java. Even if I really love it I sometimes go on adventures.<br>
            Hence I am spending some of my extra time learning new skills like web development.</p>
