        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>A middle-aged guy from switzerland who spends most of his time programming.<br>When I'm not writing
            code, I like to read books of various kinds, listen to music, podcasts or do sports.<br>Of course, I also
            enjoy spending time with my family and friends.</p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>Currently I am working as a devops engineer. My favorite thing to do is writing code and my go-to language is
            Java.<br>Even if I really love it, I sometimes go on adventures and spend some of my extra time learning new
            skills like web development.<br>Therefore, I am interested in every practice and every process of the devops
            lifecycle.</p>
